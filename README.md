Pholdbox is a lightweight php framework that includes IOC (inversion of control) and an ORM layer.  It 
is designed to make authoring sites an easy, fun process with structure and logical control paths 
(sure, we all say that about our frameworks) :). It is based on Coldbox, a ColdFusion framework.

Pholdbox is free to use, and contributions are welcome.

The framework requires PDO and PHP 7 and above, so keep that in mind :).  The main system files 
(in /system) are fairly well documented and should give you a decent idea about how to use it, as 
will the sample project skeleton and content.

Also included is a vagrant config to get a test environment up and running quickly.  

Note: Any modifications to the framework must be submitted for consideration in inclusion to the 
framework.

Note: Any enhancements/modifications/contributions you submit to the project are done so with no 
expectation for compensation (just maybe some fame, no fortune).  

Check the Downloads section for the latest releases. Master may or may not be stable.
