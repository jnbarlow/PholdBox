Pholdbox is a lightweight php framework that includes IOC (inversion of control) and an ORM layer.  It is designed 
to make authoring sites an easy, fun process with structure and logical control paths (sure, we all say that about
our frameworks) :). It is based on Coldbox, a ColdFusion framework that is very awesome.

Pholdbox is free for personal or non-profit use.  Any for profit uses will be handled on a case by case basis (super
cheap, honest -- just doing it to attach some value to the framework).  Please contact me if you are interested in 
using the framework in a business capacity -- or for training for that matter.

The framework requires PHP 5.3 and above, so keep that in mind :).  The main system files (in /system) are fairly well
documented and should give you a decent idea about how to use it, as will the sample project skeleton and content.  

If anyone wants to contribute, feel free to contact me to get more of a vision on where I'd like to see it go.  I have a
few things in the ORM that need finished, but the standard CRUD stuff is in there now.

Note: Any enhancements or contributions you submit to the project are of your own free will, and you do so with no
expectation for compensation (just maybe some fame, no fortune).
