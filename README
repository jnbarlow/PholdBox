Pholdbox is a lightweight php framework that includes IOC (inversion of control) and an ORM layer.  It is designed to make authoring sites an easy, fun process with structure and logical control paths (sure, we all say that about our frameworks) :). It is based on Coldbox, a ColdFusion framework that is very awesome.

Pholdbox is free for personal or non-profit use.  Any for profit uses will be handled on a case by case basis (super cheap, honest -- just doing it to attach some value to the framework).  Please contact me if you are interested in using the framework in a business capacity -- or for training for that matter.

The framework requires PEAR and PHP 5.3 and above, so keep that in mind :).  The main system files (in /system) are fairly well documented and should give you a decent idea about how to use it, as will the sample project skeleton and content.  

If anyone wants to contribute, feel free to contact me to get more of a vision on where I'd like to see it go.  I have a few things in the ORM that need finished, but the standard CRUD stuff is in there now.

Note: Any modifications to the framework must be submitted for consideration in inclusion to the framework.

Note: Any enhancements/modifications/contributions you submit to the project are done so with no expectation for compensation (just maybe some fame, no fortune).
