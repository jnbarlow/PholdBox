<h2>Environment Test</h2>

<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>
The PholdBox framework is modeled after the popular ColdFusion framework, <a href="http://ortus.svnrepository.com/coldbox/trac.cgi">ColdBox</a>.
Being a ColdFusion and Java Developer at heart, I came to love this framework and the power it has for rapid development and 
effecient site delivery.  I saw a need in the PHP community for a simple, easy to use framework that had the kind of power ColdBox 
provides (and I'm too lazy to learn something new), so I set about re-creating the key components in PHP.  Also being cheap, I wanted to use an application platform that was
free of license fees for personal and non-profit use. If you do plan to use it for profit, I would request you pay a small 
license fee.  I can't necessarily stop you if you don't pay me (lazy), but hey, don't be a jerk :). 
<p>

<p>
If you are a ColdFusion developer and have used ColdBox in the past, then PholdBox should feel very natural to you.  I've harnessed
the same layout/view model of ColdBox, as well as it's dependency injection for model objects.  As a bonus, I've added an easy-to-use
ORM to PholdBox to mimic the Hibernate functionality built-in to ColdFusion 9.
